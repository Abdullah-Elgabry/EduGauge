# This project aims to develop an innovative and interactive learning platform where professors can pose questions with defined answer frameworks and students can respond.
# The platform will utilize advanced natural language processing techniques to assess student responses based on their semantic similarity to the professor's pre-defined answer
# framework.
# This approach offers a more nuanced and accurate evaluation of student understanding compared to traditional assessment methods,moving beyond simple keyword matching.


#Target Audience:

# Professors and instructors in various academic disciplines.
# Students seeking an engaging and effective learning experience.
